        of the Sava and Danube rivers, where the Pannonian Plain meets the Balkans.[6] The urban area of the City of Belgrade

        One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vinča culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th
        millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and after 279 BC Celts conquered the city, naming
        it Singidūn.[7] It was conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus, and awarded city rights in the mid-2nd
        century.[8] It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire,
        Frankish Empire, Bulgarian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary before it became the capital of Serbian king Stephen Dragutin
        (1282–1316). In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo.[9]
        It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman
        wars. Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg
        post until 1918, when the city was reunited. As a strategic location, the city was battled over in 115 wars and razed
        44 times.[10] Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918.
